      <h3>The Problem:</h3>
        <p>Starting out the primary problem was a lack of mobile responsiveness. There was a decrease in traffic, indicating that the site was not getting ranked as well as it previously had been before. With Google's new search algorithm taking into account mobile responsiveness to ranking, QCMF had started to see a negative effect from this new search algorithm.</p>
        <p>The second problem was that the site was outdated and difficult to update.
