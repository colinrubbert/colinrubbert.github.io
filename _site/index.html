    <h3 class="case-study-service">Website Responsive Redesign</h3>
    <div class="case-study-description">
      <h3>The Problem:</h3>
        <p>Starting out the primary problem was a lack of mobile responsiveness. There was a decrease in traffic, indicating that the site was not getting ranked as well as it previously had been before. With Google's new search algorithm taking into account mobile responsiveness to ranking, QCMF had started to see a negative effect from this new search algorithm.</p>
        <p>The second problem was that the site was outdated and difficult to update. They were having to call their previous web design providers every time they wanted to add a photo or make a content change. This resulted in increased expenditures to fix, edit, or upload content that would be otherwise easy for anyone to do.</p>
        <h3>The Resolution:</h3>
        <p>With mobile and searching ranking strong in mind, we focused on making a quality mobile first website that was easy to use, modern, and welcoming. The result was a modern and intuitive website that had easy to find information and quality images to see previous work they had done.</p>
        <p>To solve the second problem of having to constantly contact someone to make any changes to the content of the website, we went with a content management system. Looking for a simple solution with plenty of support and a large knowledgebase we went with WordPress. From there I developed the experience to be incredibly easy to edit content and images without risking damage to the core functionality of the site.</p>
        <p>As an added sprinkle to the cake I developed procedures to ensure that search engine optimization was a first class citizen making sure that they have the best possible scenarios to ensure high ranking to in Google search.</p>

    <h1 class="case-study-title">Firehose Lightning Talks</h1>
    <h3 class="case-study-service">Ruby on Rails Web Application</h3>
    <div class="case-study-description">
      <h3>The Problem:</h3>
        <p>
          Many of the Firehose Project students are remotely placed throughout the world in locations that have a tendency to not have strong developer communities. As it was stressed to us that we needed to make connections, get comfortable talking about new technologies, and attend meetups; I had the idea to create a remote meetup for students, alumni, and mentors of the Firehose Project.
        </p>
        <h3>The Resolution:</h3>
        <p>
          Having a programming focus on Ruby on Rails I started to build out a simple CRUD application. What I wanted was a way for people to add topics to the application that they found interesting, wanted to talk about, or have someone else talk about.
        <p>
          In the beginning it had very few bells and whistles, I just wanted a simple MVP for students to easily use. Once the primary functionality was implemented and the design put in place, I open sourced it to our community.
        </p>
        <p>
          The intention about open sourcing the application was to get experience as a project manager and participent in an open source application. The other primary intention was to have a place where students could come and get some experience working on a project with a group of people. Overall it was a huge success and everyone was excited about the idea, the project, and the work that we were doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today it still runs on a free dyno on Heroku for hosting, Ruby on Rails web application framework, and a custom frontend solution.

    <div class="case-study-description">
      <h3>The Problem:</h3>
        <p>The primary issue was a lack of mobile responsiveness. There was noticeable reduction in website visits and that resulted in a dip in customer interest. Having many requests and comments from customers talking about their experience with the website made the decision clear to redesign the website with a modern feel and mobile responsiveness.</p>
        <p>While the site isn't often updated with new information it was important that when a quick changed needed to be made that PC Mechanics could easily update that information when need be.</p>
        <h3>The Resolution:</h3>
        <p>With mobile and searching ranking strong in mind, we focused on making a quality mobile first website that was easy to use, modern, and welcoming. The result was a modern and intuitive website that had easy to find information and resources.</p>
        <p>To solve the problem with easily updating content, a content management system was put into place so anyone could jump on and make simple content adjustments.</p>
        <p>In addition to the two primary focuses and issues that needed to be solved, a few key resources were added to ease day to day operations. With a clear uptick in remote support additional resources for installing remote support software and online payments were added to the website. </p>
