        <p class="article-excerpt">
          I’ve talked about mindfulness before, being in the moment and recognizing what is going on around you and inside you. I’ve recently just had to deal with some stressful family issues and work issues all during the least opportune timing, thus “Surviving The Shit Storm” post I had last week. Things have been emotional with plenty of ups, downs, stresses,...

        <p class="article-excerpt">
          It’s been my experience that life doesn’t give a shit about timing. It has no concept of it, it could give two shits about what is going on in your life. That’s why there is always a shit storm at the worst possible time ever. Time does not exist in the realm of life. It’s fuck you, take this! For...

          Being fake is one of the single most unattractive things in this world. I’m not impressed by people who try to act like something that they aren’t, the same goes for brands, personalities, and companies too. Authenticity is what impresses me, show me your flaws and your soul and we’ll be golden. I respond the best towards people, brands and...

          It’s easy to say that we are connected but the more technology replaces interaction we become more and more distant from one another and the items we interact with daily. A primary part of the human experience is connections; connections between each other, products, food, services, tools, and much more. Building a connection to our experiences is a major reason...

          It’s far too easy to get distracted in this world. I unfortunately have been experiencing this in troves. Lately I’ve been slacking on the things that I have set as goals and requirements for my day to day activities. I’ve started to lose sight of what is really necessary to continue to push forward into a positive direction. Opting for...

        <p class="article-excerpt">
          It’s a shame that in our modern society there is so much emphasis on fitting in, doing the cool thing, and being part of the herd. We’re told that we’re individuals, we want to believe that we’re individuals but really we are, for the most part, like everyone else. The good news is thought that in each and every one...

          In modern times it seems to be that when we’re called amateurs we take that as an insult, we feel our skill is being attacked, our lack of experience and pay makes us less than the professional, when in reality we should be taking it as a badge of honor and embrace our status of amateur. First I think we...

          When I decided that I would instead stop settling for average and mundane I needed to figure out what made the extraordinary people extraordinary. I’ve spent a good 6 months thinking about this concept and trying to figure out what makes people stand out from other people. How can an average person go from unremarkable to unmistakable.

          Winter always sucks me dry and I often lose my motivation and creativity during the dreary, cold, and short days of winter. I hate it, very much. I don’t think it is a mystery why things slow down and we become complacent with what we need to do. I will perpetually blame it on the weather. You see when winter...
