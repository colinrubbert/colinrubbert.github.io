          The path down a new road can be absolutely terrifying and unsettling. There is panic, uncertainty, and doubts about what will come next. The choice for change is always the easy part but the journey is where it becomes difficult and challenging. The thing though is that if you were making a major life change and it didn’t give you...

          In our modern society we take for granted all of the things that are manufactured and available to us. We have, for the most part, lost our connection to the things that we own and use because we no longer are involved in the manufacturing process. Everything is pre-processed, built, and shipped right to us. All of this is in...

          The greatest way to fulfillment is through series of challenges. I’ve found that the greatest moments in my life have come out of being challenged to a point where I nearly gave up and I felt hopeless. I get bored pretty easily when it comes to working, hobbies, really doing anything because once it’s no longer a challenge I lose...

          There’s a lot of uncertainty when it comes to making big life choices. I’m a pretty confident guy and I am very rarely ever not cool, calm, and collected. I certainly wouldn’t show my reservations or uncertainty externally but I too am affected by uncertainty and doubt. I’ve been playing tug of war with uncertainty and my confidence recently, I’m...

          Remember that when you are cursing the Gods for your misfortune it may be entirely your fault. I’ve spent 27 years on this Earth and if there is one takeaway from all that time is that good things happen to positive people and bad things happen to negative people. It’s pretty easy blaming our misfortunes on magical deities or our...

          I’ve been spending a lot of time focusing on web development recently, as if you didn’t know. I know I’ve discussed the joys of learning something new and I really can’t stress enough how important it is for everyone to spend some time and learn a new skill.

          No matter what when it comes to your dreams you can’t compromise. There are many times that we will face rejection throughout our lives but we should never let that rejection compromise our goals and ambitions.

          It’s been over month since I started to learn how to code using Ruby on Rails. It was intended to be a motivational tool to kick off learning something new every month and it has turned into something I wouldn’t have expected. Since I’ve been doing it I have felt more creative and far more fulfilled than I would’ve imagined....
