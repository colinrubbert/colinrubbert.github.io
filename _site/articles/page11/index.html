          Our brains are like any other muscle in our bodies (yes I know the brain isn’t an actual muscle but that’s besides the point). It needs to be exercised, flexed, stressed, worked, nurtured, and massaged like any other muscle in the body. Everyday I set out to do two simple things, or not simple depending on the days perspective, I...

          Last weekend I was planning on taking a little day trip to Madison to do some photography and as I was sitting there thinking about the choice of words I was using in my head I had realized that I was using phrases that were incredibly passive and didn’t hold much weight. Words and phrases like: maybe, might, I’ll let...

          I have recently set out to experiment on myself in the method of replacing bad habits with positive creative habits in my daily morning routine. The goal and task has been to ignore any social media, emails, “news”, and general unhealthy distractions in the morning and to replace them with reading inspirational material, writing, or doing anything creative.
