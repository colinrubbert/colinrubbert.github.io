          Killing off excuses are the first step to start making positive changes in your life. It’s sometimes difficult to stop making excuses for not achieving the things that you wish to achieve. It’s easy to blame money, geography, the social class you were born into, time, and a whole lot more. Why wouldn’t you blame your lack of motivation and...

          There’s moments in life where things are just so damn complicated. As humans we tend to pile the shit on and complicate life even more, it seems to be our natural states.

          This world owes you jack shit and if you think otherwise you are greatly mistaken.

          Somedays I’m just not inspired to write or rather just not snappy enough to write properly. My brain flattens out and I can’t concentrate on the things that I want to write about.

          We take for granted the beautiful design we see all around the world and on the internet. We don’t spend enough time just thinking how difficult it was for the person to spend the time to design what you see. Take for instance building a website, it seems like it would be as easy as attributing a color to an...

          Life is funny like that, jumping into something that I never would’ve thought I would’ve enjoyed turns into something that I really do love. Opened doors and exciting times all comes from jumping in blind and trying to discover life and new opportunities. See there are some, in my opinion, unexplainable forces in the Universe that pushes and pulls us...

          I think doing something out of your comfort zone where you aren’t that confident in your ability is a great way to develop yourself as a person. When we pursue things that are a bit outside of our day to day norms and abilities we get presented with opportunities to expand who we are and how we think. Learning new...

          It’s always a great experience when serendipity strikes when you start learning something new. I often find myself learning or trying new things but at the same time have no place to apply those new skills and they atrophy quickly. Since I have a massive amount of curiosity and interest in a ton of different things I have a tendency...

          I love learning, I enjoy consuming knowledge, trying things I previously didn’t know, and building things that I never knew how to build. There’s a lot to be said about the struggle of learning something new, it can strengthen the learning process and give you an ability to retain the information for a little bit longer and a bit stronger....
