          Week 3 of theFirehoseProject has been easy, difficult, informative, frustrating, and a ton of more emotions in between. The week hasn’t been imparticularly that difficult and I have managed to get a lot done.

          Exploring new ideas, experiences, hobbies, and careers paths are about being able to handle the frustration of being completely over your head. I’ve never been one to take things on that I knew wouldn’t be a challenge. If I wanted to settle, never be challenged and never take risks I would’ve stayed a metal fabricator. The more I dive deep...

When we start getting restless in our lives that’s when magical things start to happen. It can take 30 seconds or 30 years for the restlessness...
