          Three quarters of the way through theFirehoseProject wrapped up, week 9 is over. Painting a car, the 4th of July holiday weekend, and the Women’s World Cup final (which was AMAZING, hell yes USA! Carli Lloyd, what a beast but I digress) kind of threw me off my schedule a bit so I didn’t get as much in as I...

          After the wonderful performance of the Women’s World Cup by the US Women’s team I’ve come to realize that recent generations are missing something, a combined positive goal or pursuit to get rallied behind. It’s pretty easy nowadays to feel like a lone wolf and not reliant on anyone else and that we really don’t need to band together and...

          Week 8 is over and out. Another week checked off and another week of valuable learning experiences. This last week was both a technically rewarding week and a socially rewarding week with lots of good stuff peppered all around. I’ve learned how to build static pages outside of Rails by using a simple gem, experienced the value and joy of...

          We sometimes have a negative little voice in our head telling us to not do something because it’s scary, we’re going to fail, or we’re just not good enough. This voice is a nuisance and doesn’t deserve our attention and for the most part it’s a good thing to ignore this voice. The voice will always lead you down a...

          Week 7 done and done. Another week over and another week begins. I’ve got my work cut out for me for the coming week. Last week was a great example of time management. That was the biggest less that I learned. Things come up and they can certainly restrict you from completing all the things that you would’ve liked to...

          Another week in the bank, today I’m rounding out week 6 of theFirehoseProject bootcamp. Like every week of this bootcamp I’ve learned some cool things, battled with a few others, and found some wonderful pieces of advice. I’ve gone from sticking to a template and building a simple CRUD application to starting to implement my own features. Finding the resources...

I’m not ashamed of being an imposter, not at all, it means I’m jumping far outside of my comfort zone to become something that I’m currently not. It’s passion, challenge and excitement that leads me down the road of imposter syndrome. I’ve always kind of lived by the motto...

The week was surrounded with free reign to build something I’m passionate about. Like I mentioned last...
