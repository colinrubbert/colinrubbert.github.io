          One week AF (After Firehose) and I’m still fully submerged in web development awesome sauce. I had thought that with the bittersweet ending of the Firehose Project that I would be unfocused and feel lost but instead of just saying goodbye and checking out, I doubled down on the community. I had figured that the week after the Firehose Project...

          I’ve had a few days now to come to terms with the fact that theFirehoseProject is all over. It’s been an amazing ride over the last 3 months and the skills I learned will leverage me into my next career pivot. I’ve met some really great people, experienced horrible frustrations, and felt amazing triumphs. I’ve went from slowly trudging through...

          That’s a wrap folks! It’s sad to say those words. I’ve spent the last 14+ weeks (including the pre-work weeks) with the Firehose Project and tonight was my exit interview and my final group meeting. I currently have a bunch of mixed emotions joy, sadness, accomplishment, pride, belonging, and so many more. While most the emotions I have from this...

I’m just about wrapped up with my time at The Firehose Project and about ready to start a new career as a full stack web developer. Having to start out on a new career path means I’m starting out at...

          Now that week 13 is a wrap it means that my time at the Firehose Project is pretty much over, well in the sense of actual accountability and progression through the course. Last week wasn’t packed with as much code as I would’ve like it to have been but I was also on a micro vacation which I really needed....
