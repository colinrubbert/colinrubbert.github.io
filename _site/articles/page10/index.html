          I’m feeling a bit different today from the days prior, I feel a slight increase in energy and ambition after spending many days off script and not in a good way, so unproductive. I received a bit of inspiration yesterday evening and it seems to have fueled a subtle, but not unnoticeable, flame inside of me. Simply put, I’m getting...

          I use to hate waking up in the morning, if it was before 9 I cursed the world. I think having to be forced to wake up early to go to school or work as a kid was what made me dread the wee hours of the morning. As I got older and as I had to work manufacturing jobs...

          To get shit done is one of the best feelings ever, to not get the shit done that you wanted to get done is one of the worst. It’s not hard to fall short of the things that you set out to do, it really isn’t, I do it all the time. Actually, if I didn’t know any better I...

          Happiness is a thing of beauty, sometimes hard to obtain and hold on to but something the majority of people want. It is ultimately my everyday goal in my personal repertoire. At the end of the day I want to know that the things I did made me happy, big or small. I think happiness is essential to having a...

          There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so. ~ William Shakespeare I’ve been thinking about this concept a lot lately for some reason and it’s just hanging in my head. It’s an interesting concept because of how factual it proves to be. It’s an excellent example of Stoic optimism. Many of us spend a good majority...

          Reading is an essential cornerstone of creativity and not just reading junk blogs and the “news”. When I talk about reading I talk about reading stuff of substance whether it be self-improvement, nonfiction, fiction, or manuals on how to build something; if it adds value to your life in a positive way you should be reading it.

          In over your head is a state of being, it’s a place where you are forced to produce, react, and progress quickly. If you are any good at learning on the the fly, winging it, or thrive under pressure then it is likely that you live in over your head. Frankly this is the perfect state to be in, constantly...

          Being of the moment and being mindful of our feelings can be a great asset in personal progress. Many people, I could go so far as saying the majority of people especially in the US, are not conscious in the moment. They don’t rationally or objectively assess their feelings, thoughts and emotions. We get pissed off, angry, scream, rage, curse...

          Fantasy, imagination, the unconscious mind, and the subconscious brain have long captured my thoughts and attention. I find it fascinating that even when our logical brains and our extremely rationed realities seem to be the dominate force in our daily lives that there is always a part of our brain spiking in and out of influence. However, from research, we...
