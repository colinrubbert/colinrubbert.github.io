          With the new year comes new years resolutions and promises to ourselves. Really it’s the best way to start off a new year with ambition and excitement about making a change in our lives. It’s positive, good, and empowering. Unfortunately changing the things that matter is hard and we have big expectations for the change we choose to make. That’s...

          Like all things 2014 must come to an end. It was a year of massive highs, lows, and a lot of mediocrity. I have faced success, failure, rejection, heartache, joy, compassion, and a million other experiences. I have made drastic declarations, dedicated myself to becoming better, and pushing past any barriers that I have faced. 2014 in retrospect was a...

          It’s amazing how one simple act can have massive impacts on creative stimulation and creative process. Lately I have had many interruptions into my daily life, the interruptions themselves are not necessarily bad things, in fact they are important and need to be handled. There is though a significant impact that these distractions and interruptions have had on my creativity....
