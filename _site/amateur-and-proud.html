      <h1>Amateur and Proud</h1>

      <p>In modern times it seems to be that when we’re called amateurs we take that as an insult, we feel our skill is being attacked, our lack of experience and pay makes us less than the professional, when in reality we should be taking it as a badge of honor and embrace our status of amateur. First I think we need to define what amatuer and see where the word was derived from, once we do that I think it will be very clear that being an amateur is a good thing if not a <strong>GREAT</strong> thing. Amateur - a person who engages in a pursuit on an unpaid basis. Pretty damn simple, to me that reads as someone who does something because they want to not because they are made to by having cash dangled over them. The word amateur is actually derived from the latin word amare which translates to “to love” so what an amateur really is is someone who loves what they are doing. They do it because of the purity of what it is, they love it, they want it, and they want to explore it to limitless depths.  So you tell me, would you rather embrace your status of amateur or do you want to take it as an insult because you aren’t a pro.</p>

<p>The most enjoyable times that are to be had are when you are learning something new that you are really into. The returns on learning are infinite simply because you’re passionate about the task at hand. You are doing it simply because you want to. You keep at it because you love it. Whenever I learn something new because I want to I have the greatest rewards. I fall deeper and deeper in love with the thing that I am learning. Take photography for instance, I love it, truly love it. The action of taking photos speaks to me in a very visceral way, the act of studying other peoples photos helps me grow as a photographer, exploring the depths and intricacies of photography has built a love that is hard to compare with anything else, I do it because I love it. If money would be introduced into the equation and I was no longer taking photos because I wanted to but because I had to as means of survival it would lose its appeal. It would no longer be fun it would be work. Now I certainly would love to get paid to take photos, however, I would need to make sure that it was in my own way and moved in my direction, I would need complete creative freedom. It’s when money buys restrictions that things become less fun and more work.</p>

<p>Being an amateur is about the raw visceral experience of doing something you love. Being an amateur is a good thing, it should be embraced like a badge of honor. We should remember when we become a professional it is no longer about the purity of what we love it’s about the money. Pros will tell you that they do it still for the purity and joy of it all, while some may truly believe this very few actually do it for that reason, most pros do it for the notoriety, money and fame, if they say otherwise they’re most likely bullshitting you or worse, themselves. You ask an amateur why they do the things they do they will say because they love it! The amateur is the purest you will ever be in your hobby or passion. The day you go pro will be the day that you will likely lose what it meant to love what you do. Hold onto your amateur status and when you go pro, find another passion to be an amateur at, never stop being an amateur in whatever you do. Hold the purity, embrace your amateur status. Amateur and proud!</p>
