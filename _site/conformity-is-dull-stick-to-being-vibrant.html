      <h1>Conformity Is Dull, Stick To Being Vibrant</h1>

      <p>It’s a shame that in our modern society there is so much emphasis on fitting in, doing the cool thing, and being part of the herd. We’re told that we’re individuals, we want to believe that we’re individuals but really we are, for the most part, like everyone else. The good news is thought that in each and every one of us there is a vibrant uniqueness dying to explode and breakthrough to the surface. It wants to desperately show the world what makes us truly unique. Unfortunately though many of us hold onto this urge to truly show people who we are deep on the inside. We subconsciously believe that being unique is shameful and that the only way to be accepted loved and liked is to be like everyone else. This result is a society of sleep walkers and conformists.</p>

<p>First of let me start by saying, I’m just like you, I’ve got a tendency to fall in with the herd and do things because it’s the “cool” thing to do. This was much more prevalent when I was younger but today I make an honest effort to truly be myself but it can be very difficult to not fall into the trap of conformity. Conformity has a nasty effect of making us all dull and uninspiring to other people. It’s a way of stripping us of our individuality and it works to groom us for mass production servitude. Irrationally we value how similar we are to someone else and constantly compare how we stack up to the perceived successes of other people. We completely miss the best part of being human, we’re all different.</p>

<p>I’m proud to be a little off, to have crazy ideas, and to get super excited about dorky things. The beauty of life is that when we make our experiences unique to us we build a fantastical world that is truly enjoyable. Being different is good, being the same is bad. Some of the strongest influences in my life are people who show their uniqueness. They’re odd, vibrant, eccentric, they shine light on these aspects of their life. It catches your attention, it tells us that “hey, it’s great to be unique!”</p>

<p>Each of us have a unique strangeness to our personalities. Many of us will hold this strangeness in with fierce control to never show anyone who we really are, it’s the way of the conformist. When you understand that you will never get everyone to like you, you start to realize that stepping in line with everyone else is fucking boring. This is the fork in the road where you need to decide to finally bury the vibrancy that shines inside you or you let that fucker explode like a supernova. I say embrace the weird, strange, and vibrant inner you. Who wants to be dull when you can be brilliant.</p>
