      <h1>Failure Is Never A Failure</h1>

      <p>Failure should never looked at as a failure. We will, numerous times, fail miserably while attempting to do something. We will fail at work, fail at asking a potential love interest out, fail being a friend, fail at our goals, fail at being a good family member, fail at a million and half other things; our nature is to fail. I don’t believe the human race is hardwired to succeed over and over again, instead I believe the human race is hardwired to try new things over and over again failing until they figure out how to make it work.</p>

<p>Failure is not a failure but a moment in time where we get a profoundly personal learning experience. We fail, all the time, it’s what we do with that failure which defines us as a person. I’ve failed so many times in life that I can’t even count but with each everyone of those failures I have tried to find the positive out of the situation, to find the lesson in each failure and use those failures to my advantage. I often will look back on past failures and see if there was a lesson that I may have missed and if there were any more lessons that I can squeeze out of that failure.</p>

<p>Since I started to code over that last few months I have come to believe that I fail small or big at least once every time I start hacking away at code and that’s fine. Failure in the coding process is a daily encounter, some more brutal than others, but seeing that failure it will often give you a better perspective on how to solve a problem in the long run. We forget so often that life is not a sprint, it’s a marathon, today’s failure is hours, days, months, or years from nows opportunity for success. My failures of a decade or more ago can be just as useful of a lesson today as they were then.</p>

<p>Failure should never be looked at as a failure. You should never spend too much time getting down on yourself or even give up on your pursuit. Failure is a natural step in our human evolution and forever will be. Failure instead should be looked a highly personalized learning experience. Failure is not a negative but a positive, it presents an opportunity for success. Success usually only comes from series of failures big or small. When you experience a failure don’t see it as a negative, find the lesson in the failure and learn from it until you see or experience the path to success. Failures should never weaken us but embolden us to work harder and more strategically for future endeavours.</p>
