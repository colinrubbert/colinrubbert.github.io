      <h1>High On Code</h1>

      <p>As anyone who reads this knows I’ve been learning how to code, focusing primarily on web development. In all the attempts that I have conducted in the world of coding there has always been moments where I hit brick walls and give up. Not this time thought, I’ve vowed that this time I will not give up. In the last two months I’ve been working nearly everyday on learning Ruby on Rails. I’ve been learning huge amounts foundational information covering all the aspects of Web Development; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, etc. It’s been a great ride so far with many challenges and triumphs.</p>

<p>Today though, or rather the last 24 hours, marks a <strong>HUGE</strong> breakthrough that I have had. See whenever I have tried to learn a programming, coding, or a scripting language I have always hit a brick wall at arrays and then I gave up because I had no idea what the hell I was doing and just couldn’t quite figure it out. Arrays have historically been my Achilles heel. Today though was my breakthrough, today I am finally understanding what the hell I am doing and have had some pretty intense challenges going through the <a href="http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/">Firehose Project’s</a> Pre-Work course for the upcoming Firehose Project Development Bootcamp that I will be embarking on soon. I’m excited and feel like I’ve really made some excellent progress in the last few weeks on my coding abilities.</p>

<p>The pieces are all starting to come together and this post as a result will be short because I am riding a high that I just want to enjoy. The last two months have been a huge impact on my quality of life. I end each day fulfilled with what I’ve been learning and the code I’ve been developing in practice to something big. Making the decision to travel down this path has been one of the more important ones of my life and I see a very promising future with it. It’s somewhere I can make a difference, be challenged, and create cool shit; really that’s all I’ve ever wanted out of life. So today marks a special day for me, it’s the day that I broke through the first barrier. While I know there are many many more to come, today I am excited that I broke through this one and I’m confident that all the upcoming barriers will be traversable. There’s nothing we can’t achieve if we put forth 100% and when the barriers seem unbearable it’s just because you are about to breakthrough, stick with it and work harder. If the last 24 hours has proven anything, it’s that the obstacle is the way and there is no obstacle we can’t overcome.</p>
