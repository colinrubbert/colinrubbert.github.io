      <h1>Starting Anew</h1>

      <p>We can spend much of our life feeling a bit unfulfilled in our daily lives. Things become stagnant, doing the same thing day in and day out but these moments tend to breed unrest. When we start getting restless in our lives that’s when magical things start to happen. It can take 30 seconds or 30 years for the restlessness to reach a tipping point but when you crest over that peak your life changes forever. It’s been almost a year of forward momentum backed by years of restlessness and finally in the last few hours I’ve hit the tipping point. Years of restlessness and dissatisfaction has built to this point. It’s by 5 years since I reinvented myself and now it’s time to reinvent myself again. Today I committed to my new life and today marks the day I start a new journey.</p>

<p>Today is a new beginning, a fresh awakening to the future. I finally feel excited about something again, a deep passionate excitement. I’ve lived the last couple years with differing levels of unfulfillment, hopelessness, rejection, and uncertainty. Most days it doesn’t bother me at all due to my general sunny disposition on life but like everyone I even have rough days where things seem more heavy and hopeless. These are the days I use to fire the fuel to move forward in life. Those fires have brought me to a new stage of reinvention.</p>

<p>The dissatisfaction, hopelessness, restlessness and uncertainty are not our enemies but our fuel, the fuel for change. We would never change if we never had the fire our bellies to make moves. We, as human beings, are meant to keep moving forward and making progress in life. The reason why things can feel so hopeless and the struggle feel so tiring is because we get stuck doing the same thing over and over again. Our lives become a repetitive undertaking of wash, rinse, repeat. The struggle is the catalyst for us to make moves and the moves should be embraced, recognized, and valued.</p>

<p>I had my onboarding for my new journey down a new path today and damn does it feel good to have crested the tipping point. From here the view is magical, there are a million different paths I can take from here. The prospect of starting some anew is enchanting, it fills us with hope, pride, satisfaction, and inner peace. The restlessness and despair floats away to be replaced with a fresh excitement for life. That’s what we should really strive for in our life is the fresh excitement that every day should hold for us. Get out of the rut, find your inner peace and start a new journey.</p>
