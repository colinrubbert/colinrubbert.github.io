      <h1>What Would Han Do?</h1>

      <p>Our lives require a certain level of dedication to how we approach the things we want. With the right mindset and daily motto we can achieve all of the things that we wish would could do in our lives. That’s why you should always live your life by these four simple letters; WWHD. <em>What would Han do?</em> Han our favorite intergalactic smuggler and all around badass. Do you know what Han would do? He’d shoot first! Yeah that’s right George Lucas you twisted bastard Han shot first, always! Prick trying to change the story, he’s a smuggling badass he doesn’t wait to potentially get shot down first. But I digress.</p>

<p>Why would we want to live life with the motto <em>“What would Han do?”</em>, simple you should always shoot first. When it comes to your dreams we should never wait for someone else to pull the trigger because that may never happen. Instead what we should do is pull the trigger immediately and take down your goals with precision and skill. We sit around often waiting for things to happen so, in response, we can finally do the thing that we want but it seldom, if ever, comes. We can’t expect someone else to always make the first move, things don’t happen that way. We are control of our destiny not someone or something else, just us.</p>

<p>We should know that we shouldn’t rely or expect other people to initiate our life changes. No, we need to make those decisions for ourselves. Of course there can be external influence to create the catalyst for change, however, we can’t expect that external influence make the change for us. It’s impossible, we’re the only ones capable of deciding that what we want isn’t what we have and we’re going to make the difference and change our future.</p>

<p>Never wait for someone to pull the trigger on your dream, it’s a losing battle. We need to shoot first, we need to take action and we hold the power of control, no one else. Life doesn’t wait for us, it doesn’t provide us our fate, we make the moves to make our future. All of our present lives and future lives are a result of the decisions we’ve made in life. When you have a dream or want a change in your life remember to tell yourself: <em>What would Han do?</em></p>
