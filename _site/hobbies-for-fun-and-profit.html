      <h1>Hobbies For Fun And Profit</h1>

      <p>If you are lucky you will stumble upon a hobby that you love so much and that you are so passionate about that you can make a career out of it. I had been fortunate to have rekindled my love for technology when I had, it gave me something to work for and helped fill my life with accomplishment and enjoyment. Sometimes though when you take on a hobby as a career you find that the direction that you went wasn’t the perfect direction, it was close but it wasn’t quite <em>right</em>.</p>

<p>Over the last year or so I’ve been feeling like there has been something missing from my career, from my hobby. I wasn’t quite sure why I was going home feeling less and less fulfilled by what I was doing on a daily basis. This over time has generated a problem, a real problem, I go into work not looking forward to the day and I come home from work feeling like I’ve just wasted my time. The jobs get completed and I still put forth an effort and while my customers are happy I’m not.</p>

<p>Trying to find a new hobby to fill a gap and challenge myself I took a dive into web development and found that this was the path that fulfilled me. It opened to my eyes to what was missing from my job that has left me unsatisfied and unfulfilled. It’s helped me identify what it takes for me to be happy with my career. The combination of my logical thought processes, creative thought processes, building stuff, and most importantly the challenge to solve complex problems has resulted in a very enlightening insight into who I am. This has given me the opportunity to grow exponentially in the last couple months.</p>

<p>Today though is a big day for me. I take the vision of the path that I should’ve taken and make that vision a reality. Today I commit to a future down that specific path. Today I pulled the trigger on making the change I want, today I officially decided to join <em>“The Firehose Project”</em> full-stack web development boot camp. A 15 week intensive course that takes you from 0 to 100 and provides you the skills to be a junior web developer by end of course.</p>

<p>Now this may not be as interesting or spectacular to other people but the point is that you never know what you will be able to do when you develop a new hobby or interest. If you are lucky you can turn the knowledge that you built during the discovery phase and make it into a career or side income. There should never be a day where you have to work and do something that doesn’t fulfill you. Help yourself by finding the joy of a hobby and making it into a career.</p>
