I"«<p>Our lives require a certain level of dedication to how we approach the things we want. With the right mindset and daily motto we can achieve all of the things that we wish would could do in our lives. That‚Äôs why you should always live your life by these four simple letters; WWHD. <em>What would Han do?</em> Han our favorite intergalactic smuggler and all around badass. Do you know what Han would do? He‚Äôd shoot first! Yeah that‚Äôs right George Lucas you twisted bastard Han shot first, always! Prick trying to change the story, he‚Äôs a smuggling badass he doesn‚Äôt wait to potentially get shot down first. But I digress.</p>

<p>Why would we want to live life with the motto <em>‚ÄúWhat would Han do?‚Äù</em>, simple you should always shoot first. When it comes to your dreams we should never wait for someone else to pull the trigger because that may never happen. Instead what we should do is pull the trigger immediately and take down your goals with precision and skill. We sit around often waiting for things to happen so, in response, we can finally do the thing that we want but it seldom, if ever, comes. We can‚Äôt expect someone else to always make the first move, things don‚Äôt happen that way. We are control of our destiny not someone or something else, just us.</p>

<p>We should know that we shouldn‚Äôt rely or expect other people to initiate our life changes. No, we need to make those decisions for ourselves. Of course there can be external influence to create the catalyst for change, however, we can‚Äôt expect that external influence make the change for us. It‚Äôs impossible, we‚Äôre the only ones capable of deciding that what we want isn‚Äôt what we have and we‚Äôre going to make the difference and change our future.</p>

<p>Never wait for someone to pull the trigger on your dream, it‚Äôs a losing battle. We need to shoot first, we need to take action and we hold the power of control, no one else. Life doesn‚Äôt wait for us, it doesn‚Äôt provide us our fate, we make the moves to make our future. All of our present lives and future lives are a result of the decisions we‚Äôve made in life. When you have a dream or want a change in your life remember to tell yourself: <em>What would Han do?</em></p>
