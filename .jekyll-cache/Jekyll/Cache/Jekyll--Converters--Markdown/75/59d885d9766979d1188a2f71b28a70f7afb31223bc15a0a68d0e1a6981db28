I"è<p><strong>WooHoo another week done and much accomplished.</strong> This week I got an MVP done, an MVP of my business website (which I‚Äôll end up trashing and starting over because why not), and halfway through building a custom Jekyll theme that I can use for potential clients in the near future. I switched up my mindset this last week and kicked back into <em>getting shit done</em> mode.</p>
