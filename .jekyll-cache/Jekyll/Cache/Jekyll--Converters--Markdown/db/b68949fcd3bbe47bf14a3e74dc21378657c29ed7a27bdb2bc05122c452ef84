I"›<p>I love learning, I enjoy consuming knowledge, trying things I previously didn‚Äôt know, and building things that I never knew how to build. There‚Äôs a lot to be said about the struggle of learning something new, it can strengthen the learning process and give you an ability to retain the information for a little bit longer and a bit stronger. It‚Äôs traditionally been how I have learned the majority of the things that I know, I very seldom ever actually throw money at a problem and I rarely ever pay to learn something new. However, sometimes the best solution is to spend that money when you are learning something new. A paid teacher can get you to a specific point faster than trying to wing it on our own. One place that I have always struggled with when trying to learn something on my own is programming or coding. It‚Äôs very conceptual and abstract and for me it is a difficult topic to learn without being shown and actually explained why things are happening the way in which they are. I need that visual and auditory explanation. Which brings me to the inevitable conclusion, sometimes the best solution is throwing money at it.</p>

<p>The last few days I‚Äôve been pondering over what project and which direction I want to go with kicking off my learning/building something new every month. I decided to finally dedicate time to learning Ruby on Rails. I‚Äôve been wanting to learn rails for a <strong>VERY</strong> long time, however, any time that I tried to learn it I was overwhelmed and confused about what the hell was going on. I‚Äôve probably tried at least 6 or 7 times to learn on my own with varying degrees of success, if you can even call it that, but I didn‚Äôt retain any of it. I‚Äôm not going to go into too much details about what RoR is, if you want to know google it, but I‚Äôve got a ton of ideas for web services and applications and rails is the best solution for the majority of them. There are a <strong>ton</strong> of web services we use everyday that is built on the back of rails. I figured if I was going to jump start my first month of learning and/or building something new I might as well dive in with something that can give me a great foundation for future months and projects.</p>

<p>Back to the struggle, coding and programming concepts fly straight over my head when I try to learn them myself or at the very best it takes me weeks to understand certain concepts and even then I‚Äôm not 100% confident in the knowledge I‚Äôve learned. This is a prime example of throwing money at a problem where it is actually beneficial. I‚Äôve been doing a one month writing challenge for my morning entries lately by a company appropriately named ‚Äú<a href="https://onemonth.com">One Month</a>‚Äù, each day they deliver a writing topic to boost creativity and build writing habits, it‚Äôs been fun. While actually looking into the company I had noticed that they offer reasonably priced online classes for certain coding languages, growth hacking, and web security. After the initial struggle with being a tight ass when it comes to spending my hard earned money and my own pride when it comes to admitting that I need help, I researched the company and decided that I would take a chance and purchase the ‚Äú<a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails">One Month Rails</a>‚Äù course. I‚Äôve got to say I‚Äôm not disappointed and so far I have learned more about rails, git, and GitHub than I had in all of my previous attempts at learning RoR.</p>

<p>For me, and probably you too, it takes a bit of faith and confidence to throw money with little certainty of what kind of return I will experience. I have a fear of buyers remorse whenever I impulse buy something thus the reason why I do my damndest to learn or do everything myself, at least if it doesn‚Äôt work out I didn‚Äôt lose money, just time. However, somethings are worth it and my time is certainly precious. With taking a bit of a risk in learning something new and spending a relatively low amount of money I have created an entry into a very solid foundation that can help me build much more in the future. We can never truly know what taking a risk can have in store for us but sometimes we just need to take that jump. And sometimes the best solution is throwing money at the problem.</p>
