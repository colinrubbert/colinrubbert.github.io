I"æ<p>Having taken a couple of side jobs this week I didnâ€™t get to put as much time into coding as I had hoped this week but it all works in the larger scheme of things for my next move. Currently Iâ€™ve been working to build out my IT consulting business and currently gearing up to include web design and development to the list of services I can provide. Sometimes youâ€™ve just got to take things into your own hands. I did get some coding in and development related activities.</p>
